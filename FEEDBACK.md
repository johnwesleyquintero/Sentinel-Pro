Given a WPF application exhibiting Windows SDK dependency conflicts and build failures, refactor the SentinelPro project to achieve a minimal, functional state. Prioritize removing the CsWinRT dependency and associated configurations from the SentinelPro.csproj file. Subsequently, ensure the MainWindow.xaml and HomePage.xaml files are correctly configured to display basic UI elements, establishing a stable foundation for incremental feature re-introduction and dependency management. The ultimate goal is a clean build demonstrating core WPF functionality, enabling a systematic approach to resolving the original dependency issues. Clean project folder `Sentinel-Pro` and remove files we dont need `EXCEPT` for `wwwroot` folder, `Assets` use the assests as much as possible for branding and icons and `netlify.toml` for hosting our landing and build release `SentinelPro.exe`.
