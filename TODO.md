I need your assistance in addressing errors and implementing improvements based on your suggestions. Below is the task list:

**TASK LIST:**

1. **Codebase Cleanup:**
   - [x] Remove old references from `WorkspaceCleanup` to `SentinelPro` across the entire codebase.
   - Delete outdated files and perform a thorough cleanup of the codebase.
   - Alternatively, reset all configurations to `SentinelPro` for better clarity and organization.

2. **GitHub Pipeline Setup:**
