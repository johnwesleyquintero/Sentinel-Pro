# SENTINEL PRO ROADMAP - PROJECT MANAGEMENT - MILESTONE TRACKING

## 1.0.0

**FYI:**

1. We have a landing page at wwwroot\index.html this serves as our landing page where users can download our releases and therefore, we should keep this directory `wwwroot` and dont't delete `netlify.toml` as they host our landing page.

2. Don't delete this `TODO.md` too because how would we track our development progress if we dont have this?
