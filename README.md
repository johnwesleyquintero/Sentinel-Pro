| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No Backups Displayed**   | Verify `rollback_info.json` exists and is accessible; check configured backup location permissions.             |
| **Error Messages**         | Review the status bar or application logs (`Logs` folder) for detailed error information.                       |
| **Backup/Restore Failures**| Ensure Sentinel Pro has necessary read/write permissions for source and target directories; check disk space.  |
| **Slow Performance**       | Check system resources (CPU, RAM, Disk I/O); consider adjusting the compression level or excluding large files. |
| **AI Features Not Working**| Verify your Gemini API key is correct and active; ensure a stable internet connection.                          |
