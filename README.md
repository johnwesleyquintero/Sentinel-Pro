| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No Backups Displayed**   | Verify `rollback_info.json` exists and is accessible; check configured backup location permissions.            |
| **Error Messages**         | Review the status bar or application logs (`Logs` folder) for detailed error information.                      |
| **Backup/Restore Failures**| Ensure Sentinel Pro has necessary write/read permissions for source and target directories; check disk space. |
| **Slow Performance**       | Check system resources (CPU, RAM, Disk I/O); consider adjusting compression level or excluding large files.    |
| **AI Features Not Working**| Verify your Gemini API key is correct and active; ensure a stable internet connection.                         |
